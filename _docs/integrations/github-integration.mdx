## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An EkLine API token provided by the EkLine contact person. <!-- Can you link here to how to find a contact person? Such as a page with your contact info, or even an email address directly -->

<!-- Any other prereqs? Surely I have to have a GitHub repo? -->

<!-- Don't I have to configure my style guide in EkLine first?? Otherwise, the integration won't know what rules to apply? -->

## I. Create a new GitHub Actions workflow

In your GitHub repository:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab. 
<!-- My pref is to use bold for literals (filenames, UI elements, commands, etc.) -->

2. Click **New workflow** and choose the **set up a workflow yourself** option.

3. Name the new workflow file **ekline.yml**. This file is stored in your repository in the **.github/workflows/** directory.
<!-- I prefer to use only one form of highlighting at a time (only italic OR only bold, not both) -->

## II. Configure the EkLine GitHub Action

Now that you've [created a new GitHub Actions workflow](#i-create-a-new-github-actions-workflow), you need to configure it.

1. Copy and paste the following template into your **ekline.yml** workflow file:

   ```yaml
   name: EkLine
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - master
         - main
     pull_request:
   jobs:
     test-pr-review:
       if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
       name: runner / EkLine Reviewer (github-pr-review)
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - uses: ekline-io/ekline-github-action@v5.8.0
           with:
             content_dir: ./src/docs
             ek_token: ${{ secrets.ek_token }}
             github_token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
             reporter: github-pr-review
             filter_mode: added
             # ignore_rule: "EK00001,EK00004" # Optional
   ```

2. Adjust the configuration options to fit your repository. The available options are:

   - **content_dir**: The content directory relative to the root directory (default: **.**).
   - **ek_token**: The token for the EkLine application ([required](#prerequisites).
   - **filter_mode**: The filtering mode for the EkLine reviewer command. This value controls how the EkLine reviewer filters results. The available filter modes are:

         - **added** (default): Filter results by added or modified lines.
         - **diff_context**: Filter results by diff context. That's, changed lines +-N lines (N=3, for example).
         - **file**: Filter results by added or modified file. EkLine reviewer will report results as long as they are in an added or modified file, even if the results aren't in the actual diff.
         - **nofilter**: Don't filter any results. Useful for posting results as comments as much as possible and checking other results in the console simultaneously.

   - **github_token**: The **GITHUB_TOKEN** (default: **${{ secrets.github_token }}**). <!-- Okay, but what is this and where do I get it? -->

   - **reporter**: The reporter of the EkLine review command. <!-- Does that mean this is a person? Okay, I can see that it's not a person, but I don't understand what this element is for. It's the output destination for the results of the EkLine GH Action? -->

         - **github-pr-check** (default): Reports results to GitHub Checks.
         - **github-check**: Similar to **github-pr-check**, but works for both pull requests and commits.
         - **github-pr-review**: Reports results to GitHub pull request review comments using a GitHub Personal API Access Token.

## [Optional] Ignoring Specific Rules

You can optionally direct the GitHub integration to ignore certain rules.
<!-- What's an example situation or reason why I'd want to do this? -->

To ignore some rules during the review process, you can use the **ignore_rule** flag. This flag accepts a comma-separated list of rule identifiers that you wish to skip.

For example, if you want to ignore rules `EK00001` and `EK00004`, you can set the `ignore_rule` flag in your configuration like this:

```
			  ignore_rule: "EK00001,EK00004"
```

<!-- Where do I get this EK**** code? Is there a human-readable version of this so that I don't have to look up the code laboriously? -->

## III. Save and commit the workflow file

After you've configured the [workflow file](#configure-the-ekline-github-action), do the following to put it to work:

1. Click **Start commit** to save and commit the file to your repository. 
2. Trigger the EkLine GitHub Action by doing one of the following:

   * When you push changes to the **master** or **main** branches.
   * Create a pull request.

## Add the EkLine API token to your repository secrets

Before the GitHub Action can work, you need to provide the EkLine API token. Go to your repository settings, navigate to the "Secrets" tab, and add a new secret with the name **`ek_token`**. Paste your EkLine API token as the value.
<!-- If this step has to be done before any of the above will work... shouldn't this section (#add-the-ekline-api-token-to-your-repository-secrets) be placed earlier in the doc? -->

## Grant Write Permissions to Workflows

To enable the EkLine GitHub Action to add comments to pull requests, you must grant write permissions to workflows.

To do this, navigate to **Settings > Code and Automation > Actions > General > Workflow permissions**. Then, click the drop-down menu and select **"Read and write permissions"**. Click on **"Save"** to apply the changes.

/>


## IV. Monitor the EkLine GitHub Action results

Once the EkLine GitHub Action runs, you can view the results in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

Now, you have integrated the EkLine GitHub Action into your repository for automated documentation review. Enjoy better quality and consistency in your documentation.
